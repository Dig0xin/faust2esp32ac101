Trying to get Ivo Pullens AC101 driver to work inside the faust2esp32 tool.

At this stage I must have missed one point and I am getting some unexpected includes after running the script.
Those result in file not found errors.

It would be great to have a board selection inside the faust2esp32 once those issues are sorted out instead of the faust2esp32ac101 file I am using for testing.
